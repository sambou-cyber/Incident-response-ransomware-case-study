# Incident Response Documentation, Ransomware via Phishing (Healthcare)

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to analyze and document a cybersecurity incident using standard incident response practices. The scenario focuses on a simulated ransomware attack against a small U.S. healthcare clinic and highlights incident documentation, root cause analysis, and business impact.

## Scenario Summary
A healthcare clinic experienced a ransomware attack that disrupted business operations and prevented employees from accessing critical patient data. The attack originated from targeted phishing emails containing a malicious attachment, which deployed ransomware once executed.

## Objectives
- Document a security incident using structured incident response methodology
- Identify attack vectors and root cause
- Assess operational and business impact
- Communicate incident details clearly and professionally

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident response documentation
- Ransomware and phishing attack analysis
- Use of the 5 W’s (Who, What, When, Where, Why)
- Business impact assessment
- Security awareness and prevention considerations
- Technical writing and communication

## Tools & Techniques
- Incident handler journal methodology
- Scenario-based threat analysis
- Written incident reporting  
*(No live tools were used; this project focuses on documentation and analysis.)*

## Deliverables
- Incident response documentation in PDF format
- Clear incident summary and analysis suitable for SOC and entry-level security roles
